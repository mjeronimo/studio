# Tasks
* Change highlight color for 'X' in RosNode
* Remove RosNode upon clicking 'X'
* Merge nodes and edges into elements (state) so that rendering happens in one pass upon setElements
* Move the layout direction to the Settings panel
* Fix the "two nodes at the same level" issue
* Perform an initial off-screen rendering so that nodes have sizes when laying out
    * Hopefully, dynamic size changes don't layout in an ackward way (like nodes flipping sides)
* Limit length of title string (use "...")
* Change border style for RosNodes upon select
* Change border style for RosTopics upon select
* Split out connection points, per topic
* Merge Audrow's changes

# Done

* Fix the "Filter nodes" counter (right justify; see RosNode header for 'flex' layout)
